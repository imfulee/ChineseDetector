The world around us is such a miraculous and amazing place which is filled with affecionts and wonder.Every single moment ,there is a surge of happiness and overwhelmingly strong love flows just like an erupting volcano on this planet earth.Thus, i wonder if this was the reason that i falled in love with you at the very first sight in my life.I really have no idea.I have been douting about myself since the first day when i met wiht you.Am i insane? What the hell i was thingking?Hesitation and frustrations overwhelms me , i walked alone in the terrifyring darkness without any light and hope. No,indeed,there was a light,there was a hope--the world's most charming and elegent smile on your graceful face which deeply imprinted in my mind.At that moment,that time, a lighting sparked into my mind that you are the one who i have been waiting for such a long time, you are the one which i should protect and cherish during my whole life.And then ,i figure out it is the willing from gods--YOU ARE MY DESTINY. 頂一記！希望她可以看到 我看到我，明顯看不懂，主要是密集恐懼症 我給滿分 頂一記！ 優秀
