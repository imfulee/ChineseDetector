雖然是10/30的舊聞 但好像都沒人貼?剛好看到 https://bit.ly/3nmRzOr Prior to launch we reported that AMD had not confirmed to AIBs the existence of Radeon RX 6900 XT SKU although the AIBs we spoke with already knew about it. The announcement of reference AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT earlier this week and the few custom Radeon RX 6800 XT models yesterday does appear to confirm that board partners were not allowed to prepare the custom 6900XT cards for launch. We were told by AIBs this week that the delay of RX 6900XT to December 8th could mean that AMD will in fact allow board partners to customize the design (eventually). AMD has no technical reasons to block AIBs from customizing the design only financial reasons. It does not prevent AMD from disallowing AIBs to sell reference RX 6900XT cards although that also has not yet been confirmed. AMD Radeon RX 6900XT and RX 6800XT have a lot in common. The cards share the same clock speeds: 2015 MHz game clock and 2250 MHz boost clock. The SKUs also share the same memory layout: 16GB GDDR6 256bit. More importantly though these cards use the same Navi 21 GPU with the same power requirements (300W). Thus a custom Radeon RX 6900XT design would require very limited resources from AMD partners as the board designs are ready and cooling solutions are already preconfigured for the same power envelope. Today Andreas Schilling from HardwareLuxx reported that AMD is in talks with AIBs about custom RX 6900XT models. Hopefully the customization wont be limited to sticker replacement: https://i.imgur.com/HzvnEvK.png 1UpWgAK2 (PC_Shopping) 感謝大大補充 >//////<。amd在同樣的腳位上做出新的cpu。intel在同樣的cpu做出新的腳位。會有手提箱包裝的6900XT嗎?。微星出的非公維修會有料修跟強迫打七折嗎？。限制比較好，不然後面都買不到公版。每次都要搶首發很累。AMD公版有這麼搶手？。期待 比較喜歡非公版的。3090的末日>///<。推簽名檔XD。能否非公的關鍵是GG給的產能要夠。同級999跟對手1499的價差太大。板卡廠應該都覺得很有操作空間。比公版貴個200美元也是會賣光。推發情豹紋！！！。發情豹紋。簽名檔笑死。推發情豹紋。推簽名檔認真了。看看非公貨會不會比較多。推發情豹紋！！！。爽爽爽 就等6900XT ROG。乾 簽名檔..。坐等發情豹紋色。就看穩定性如何 希望別再重演去年的噩夢
