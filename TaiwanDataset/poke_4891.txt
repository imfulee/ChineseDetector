http://switchaboo.com/2018/01/11/satoruiwata/ As development for Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver progressed Iwata created compression tools that would allow for the games to contain the original Kanto regions in addition to the new Johto region. This became a monumental success and the team at Game Freak were amazed as to how much he could fit onto a Game Boy cartridge. When Game Freak were developing Pokémon Stadium for the Nintendo 64 they realised that they had no specification documents left for the battle system. Iwata didnt work at either Game Freak nor Nintendo but he acted as an intermediary between them. He studied the original source code for the battle system and was able to successfully implement it in Pokémon Stadium in just one week. [Shigeki Morimoto] said “I created that battle program and it really took a long time to put together. But when I heard that Iwatasan had been able to port it over in about a week and that it was already working Well I thought: “What kind of company president is this?” Just my comment here: the technical ability of Satoru Iwata was absolutely incredible. For a company president to also be so skilled at development is a great feat. 金銀可以雙地圖是聰哥協助開發搞出來的這大家都知道不用多說了。 在開發寶可夢競技場64的時候，因為不管是GF還是任天堂當初都沒有想過 寶可夢會以這樣的形式去登陸，所以也沒有留下任何規格說明跟程式計劃書來 提供給寶可夢競技場64做參考。 而岩田聰那時也不是GF或者任天堂的程式人員，但他加入了這個計畫 並且花了一週的時間同時研究GB的寶可夢原始碼加以解析並且完成了這個工作。 森本茂樹：我當初開創這個戰鬥系統可是花了非常長的時間，而當我聽到 岩田先生用了一週時間在做這件事並且已經可以執行的時候... 我在想著這人到底是什麼樣的公司總裁阿 聰哥真的是程式怪物................. 我的名片上，他寫著公司總裁；我自己看來，我是遊戲設計師， 然而在我心中，我只是個玩家 岩田聡 遊戲開發者大會2005 9399他都是hal的社長就是了。可是他掛了，看來今年趕不出來了。來個皮卡丘高爾夫致敬吧。感嘆聰哥 讚嘆蔥哥。鎖區的爸爸。。控制碼?。Switch的催生者。N64時期的身分 絕對不是總裁。五樓GF 0.0。老社長慈眉善目又有強大的能力 我覺得能從pokemon本。傳的RS開始接手 然後在重製的ORAS辭世 也算是一種浪。漫 (雖然也還想再玩有他在的新作 QQ)。好人不長命QAQ。只能淚推了QQ
