10nm SuperFin Atom TGL UP3 for Embedded. 連Atom都先上10nm了... 原文縮址: https://reurl.cc/j5vaLD ========================================================================== Intel Announces 10nm SuperFin Atom x6000E Elkhart Lake Celeron and Pentium CPUs Intel announced its new Atom x6000E series Elkhart Lake of processors today along with Pentium and Celeron N and J series chips all targeted at industrial embedded and IoT applications. Intel is also pressing its Tiger LakeUP3 chips into service for edge applications that require a higher level of performance. The Atom x6000E Pentium and Celeron processors feature either dual or quadcore Tremont designs. Base frequencies for the Atom models vary between 1.2 to 1.8 GHz while boost speeds top at at 3.0 GHz for chips that come with the feature. The Atom chips serve the 4.5W to 12W TDP range while Intel splits the Pentium and Celeron processors into 6.5W and 10W variants. All models have baked in support for up to 64GB of dualchannel DDR43200 or LPDDR4x4267 memory much like the Tiger Lake processors and come in BGAmounted packages meaning they arent socketed processors. Intel also segments the stack by only providing ECC support for the Atom processors. The lineup comes with Gen11 graphics which Intel says offers up to twice the performance of the Gen9 graphics found on priorgen models. Atom also takes a step forward courtesy of the Tremont architecture to notch a 1.7X gain in singlethreaded workloads and 1.5X gain in multithreaded work over previousgen Goldmont Plus As we see with chips destined for the IoT space Intel offers a seven to tenyear support window and that includes ensuring the chips will be available throughout that same window. Intel also leans in on AI support with this generation including support for the OpenVINO toolkit that includes containerized packages to speed deployment of automation sensing and vision applications. Intel is also pressing its Tiger LakeUP3 chips into service for applications that require a higher level of performance. These chips come with all of the normal trimmings of the Tiger Lake processors which you can read about indepth here like the 10nm SuperFin process Xe LP graphics Thunderbolt 4 and support for AVX512 and VNNI. 。因為10nm廢的只有這種低階東西才能用啊。8c16t的4g根本生不出來 廢到笑。就時脈拉不上去所以桌面用CPU一直出不來啊。出來性能比上代還弱能看嗎？。這應該會出現在surface go上吧？。管他幾nm，Atom還是Atom。這在surface go. 不如去買IPad air。好廢。會有效能評測嗎?。效能+20%哪怕只有3Ghz都會上，想當年笑AMD高頻低能。sg用的是core-i y系列啦，早就不用atom了。是阿綜合效能比前代高哪有不出的問題。Atom就只是顆Atom。目前i皇10nm都是出給低頻低功耗的u阿。因為電晶體少, 良率容易拉高。如果Pentium N系列放完整的avx, avx2 我覺得蠻有競。爭力的，至少舊的Q9000系列U都比不上，應該可以接。近預設的一代core i。低時脈低效能給Atom非常合情合理啊。AVX大多情境根本不會用到 低階Low power的更是不太。可能用到。反正阿痛就沒被放棄 拿去做大小核了 在單獨出純小核。的天經地義 IP盡可能用 加減發揮價值 反正都設計了。小U純轉檔沒avx真的等到天荒地老。轉檔用avx？有SSE4.1就很充足了。這種拉機拿來轉檔幹嘛 大家這麼愛轉檔喔。拿atom轉檔是有沒有這麼愛轉啊...。良率太低的關係吧。真的就是良率問題而已啦 別說了。可以生出來沒問題 但出貨就大爆死 還不如不發佈。問轉擋是因為有nas場景應用吧。拉不上去只能給拉基ATOM練功 10nm++=14++++真的笑噴。NAS也是靠QSV轉吧...靠ATOM本身NAS會卡死在那吧。一定卡死，atom根本沒本事跑實時轉檔。nas是用硬壓阿。以前低價win平板還都是atom..現在都變成nas機了。我以為atom都是0.1nm 沒想到Intel做出10nm的atom
