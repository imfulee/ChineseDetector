https://reurl.cc/Md9br3 AMD Radeon RX 6800 6800 XT and 6900 XT aim at Nvidias besteven the RTX 3090 Hello RDNA 2. Heres everything AMD revealed about the Radeon RX 6000series graphics card and the new tech inside them. By Brad Chacos Senior Editor PCWorld OCT 28 2020 9:28 AM PDT Welcome back to the high end AMD. For the first time since the days of the Radeon R9 290Xseven long years ago AMDs Radeon group is prepared to unleash enthusiastlevel graphics cards that can do battle with Nvidias best and brightest. During the companys second “Where Gaming Begins” event on Wednesday AMD revealed a trio of Radeon GPUs based on a new RDNA 2 architecture all armed with “ revolutionary Infinity Cache” technology skyhigh clock speeds and interesting synergies with Ryzen. They take direct aim at Nvidias RTX 30series offerings culminating in a 999 Radeon RX 6900 XT that seeks to seize the gaming crown from the monstrous 1500 GeForce RTX 3090 when it launches December 8for 500 less than Nvidias beastly GPU costs. The 579 Radeon RX 6800 meanwhile will go toetotoe with the 500 RTX 3070 releasing tomorrow and the 649 Radeon RX 6800 XT intends to challenge the 700 RTX 3080. Both launch November 18 about two weeks after AMDs Ryzen 5000 CPUs hit the streets. [ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ] ultimate gaming platform AMD While Nvidias recent gaming GPU releases went light with raw memory capacity opting for an upgrade to faster GDDR6X VRAM instead AMD equipped every highend Radeon RX 6000 card with a substantial 16GB of standard GDDR6 plenty to handle 4K gaming well into the future. And while Nvidias RTX 3080 and 3090 consume much more power than previous GeForce incarnations AMD claims its achieved its lofty goal of a 50 percent performanceperwatt increase compared to the original RDNA architecture which makes the Radeon RX 6000series XT graphics cards less powerhungry than their Nvidia rivals. Yes you read that right: Radeon GPUs will need less power than competing GeForce cards. My how the tables have turned. Well start by diving into the raw specs and performance claims for the Radeon RX 6800 6800 XT and 6900 XT because we know thats what youre here for but stick around afterward when we dig into key changes in the RDNA 2 architecture and new Radeon ecosystem features like Smart Access Memory that ties into Ryzen 5000 CPUs and AMDs new Infinity Cache. Those provide crucial additional context for some of the slides youre about to see. TABLE OF CONTENTS Radeon RX 6800 vs. GeForce RTX 3070 Radeon RX 6800 XT vs. GeForce RTX 3080 Radeon RX 6900 XT vs. GeForce RTX 3090 RDNA 2 and Infinity Cache Ryzen synergy Rage and DirectX 12 Ultimate Radeon RX 6800 vs. GeForce RTX 3070 radeon rx 6800 AMD Lets start at the more affordable end. The Radeon RX 6800 packs 60 compute units and a 1815MHz game clock90MHz higher than the rival GeForce RTX 3070s rated Boost speed. More importantly AMDs card triumphs in memory capacity packing a full 16GB of GDDR6 RAM versus the 3070s 8GB. Nvidia pitched the 3070 as the ultimate 1440p graphics card but it can do well in 4K games too. That 8GB memory buffer probably wont hold up well for 4K gaming as the years go on though as some games already exceed it. The Radeon RX 6800 wont suffer the same problem. Nvidias card enjoys a slightly lower total board power rating. radeon rx 6800 4k AMD radeon rx 6800 1440 AMD Now things are getting interesting. Vendor benchmarks should always be taken with a grain of salt and you should always wait for independent reviews of pricey hardware but AMDs data tends to be reliableand it shows the Radeon RX 6800 beating the GeForce RTX 3070 across the board here at both 4K and 1440p resolution. Wow. Radeon chief Scott Herkelman told me that AMDs lab used identical systems for all tests changing only the graphics card and that the company used the bestperforming API for a given graphics card in all tests. So if Nvidias GPU performed better in a game using DirectX 11 and AMDs exceled with DX12 these results reflect apex performance. Its not quite as cutanddry as it looks however. See that tiny “Smart Access Memory” next to the Radeon RX 6800s name at the bottom? This graphs shows AMD performance with that feature active which can provide an additional performance boost when you drop a Radeon 6000 GPU into a system with a Ryzen 5000 CPU installed. Well get into it more later but these aren t stock results for the RX 6800. Radeon RX 6800 XT vs. GeForce RTX 3080 radeon rx 6800 xt AMD Stepping up the stack the Radeon RX 6800 XT increases the compute unit count to 72 game clock speeds to a hair over 2GHz and the total board power to 300 watts. It also offers a roomy 16GB of memory. By comparison Nvidias GeForce RTX 3080 has a Boost clock nearly 300MHz slower (though it tends to run faster in reality) and just 10GB of memory though it uses the faster GDDR6X variety for more bandwidth. The Radeon RX 6800 XTs 300W power rating is 20W less than the RTX 3080s. radeon rx 6800 xt 4k AMD radeon rx 6800 xt 1440 AMD In these results AMD isnt putting its thumb on the scale with Smart Access Memory. In its stock state the Radeon RX 6800 XT meets or flatout beats the GeForce RTX 3080 in 7 of the 10 benchmarks here at 4K resolution where Nvidia s card performs its best. Drop the resolution to 1440p where Nvidias Ampere cant take full advantage of its abundant shaders and AMD opens its lead even more triumphing in every game except Division 2 and Resident Evil 3. Hot damn. Radeon RX 6900 XT vs. GeForce RTX 3090 radeon rx 6900 xt AMD Now we get to the battle of the (almost) Titans. The Radeon RX 6900 XT packs identical specifications to the Radeon RX 6800 XT except one boosting the critical compute unit count from 72 to 80. Yes it still runs over 2GHz and yes it still sticks to 300W of total board power50W less than the powersucking GeForce RTX 3090. Nvidias marketing for the 3090 revolved around 8K gaming and the cards massive creatorfriendly 24GB of GDDR6X memory. The company even calls the stepdown RTX 3080 its gaming flagshipnot the 3090. AMD is keeping the focus on normal gamers with the Radeon RX 6900 XT. This card comes with 16GB of standard GDDR6 memory just like the other Radeon GPUs revealed today. It s not as spacious and not as fast as the RTX 3090s memory but 16GB of GDDR6 should hold up well for 4K gaming over the long term nonetheless. Opting for a less extreme VRAM setup means AMD can keep the cost of the Radeon RX 6900 XT much lower compared to its rival. radeon rx 6900 xt 4k AMD So many people thought this was impossible but here we areat least in AMD s supplied benchmarks. The Radeon RX 6900 XT beats or ties the GeForce RTX 3090 more often than not at 4K and substantially so in Forza with all games blowing well past the golden 60framespersecond mark even with their highest visual settings enabled. Note that AMD is tipping the scales again here and more so than before. Not only is Smart Access Memory active on the Radeon system but so is Rage AMD s new automatic overclocking tool in Radeon Software. A victory is a victory but you cant help but wonder how much extra performance those features are adding to the top. A slide youll see later shows the duo improving performance by anywhere from 2 to 13 percent depending on the game with an average uplift of 6.4 percent across eight games. Its also worth noting however just how much cheaper the Radeon RX 6900 XT is compared to the luxurious GeForce RTX 3090. 500 aint chump change. Thats it as far as the Radeon RX 6000series graphics cards themselves go. For a deeper look at the RDNA 2 architecture and new features inside AMDs highend GPUsincluding Rage Smart Access Memory and Infinity Cachekeep reading. RDNA 2 and Infinity Cache per per watt AMD AMD knew that to catch up to Nvidia its GPUs needed to become much more efficient than they used to be. RDNA 1 achieved a 50percent power improvement over previous Radeon GPUs but a large part of the efficiency gains came from moving to the advanced 7nm manufacturing process. The RDNA 2 architecture stays on 7nm so AMDs engineers needed to boost its efficiency by another 50 percent in other ways. compute units AMD It started with the compute unitsthe beating heart of the GPU. AMDs graphics chief engineer Laura Smith said the company went through the design with a finetooth comb to root out inefficiencies: rejiggering data paths rebalancing pipelines and (in a page from the Ryzen design handbook) enabling “pervasive finegrain clock gating” which is an interesting twist Im looking forward to hearing more about as GPUs behave very differently than CPUs. The new compute units are 30 percent more efficient than before which Smith says is crucial for scaling RDNA up to these enthusiastclass GPUs. frequency AMD AMDs engineers also managed to squeeze much higher clock speeds out of RDNA 2 on the performance side of things. Where the Radeon RX 5700 XT sported a 1755MHz game clock AMD says the Radeon RX 6800XT and 6900XT should sustain 2015MHz speeds during gaming and can even go to 2250MHz in other tasks. (Smith actually says the Radeon RX 6900 XTs powerperwatt increase versus RDNA 1 was even higher at 65 percent.) infinity cache AMD But the most intriguingand mysteriouspower gains come from the new 128MB “Infinity Cache” built into the Radeon RX 6000series. Smith says the Infinity Cache is a highdensity design that has its roots in “Zen 3” Ryzen s cache decisions but rearchitected for Radeons gaming needs. Details of what Infinity Cache actually does remain murky but Smith says it basically allows Radeon RX 6000 graphics cards to deliver twice the memory bandwidth at lower power cost. Including Infinity Cache lets AMD stick to a smaller 256bit bus for the Radeon RX 6000series which provides substantial power savings over moving to the larger bus sizes you normally see in highend gaming cards. We cant wait to hearand testmore. Ryzen synergy Rage and DirectX 12 Ultimate Hardware cant run without software and part of AMDs presentation was dedicated to showcasing some nifty new capabilities found in Radeon RX 6000 graphics cards. Most intriguing? AMD Smart Access Memory. amd smart access memory AMD Like AMDs Smart Shift technology in laptops (and the RDNA 2based PlayStation 5) AMD Smart Access Memory is designed to give you better performance if youre allin on AMDs hardware. If you have both a Ryzen 5000 CPU and a Radeon 6000 GPU in your system AMD Smart Access Memory gives your CPU access to your graphics cards full memory buffer rather than the usual 256MB chunks. That direct communication cuts down on buffering and potential latency. Even though game makers havent had a chance to optimize for the closely guarded tech yet Radeon chief Scott Herkelman told PCWorld that simply flipping this feature and Rage overclocking on simultaneously in AMDs labs resulted in performance increases across a series of games with Forza Horizon 4 running 13 percent faster. amd smart access memory and rage AMD Fascinating stuff. As with Infinity Cache were looking forward to seeing deeper details but several AMDsupplied benchmarks for the Radeon RX 6000 GPUs show results from numerous games with Smart Access Memory active. AMDs new cards will also support Microsofts upcoming DirectStorage API which will let your GPU talk directly to your NVMe SSD for vastly improved loading times in games. Getting the various parts of your PC to talk directly rather than flowing through system RAM suddenly seems like the hot new trend for 2021. (Nvidias RTX 30series also supports DirectStorage using “RTX IO ” branding.) rage AMD AMD is also spiffing up the oneclick overclocking capabilities found in its Radeon Software. Going forward youll find a new “Rage” preset tuning option that applies an automatic overclock tuned to your specific carda helpful tool indeed for people who just want their games to play as quickly as possible with no headaches. Herkelman told me there are some slight differences compared to the previous automatic overclocking feature offered by Radeon software but he didnt get into specifics. Fun fact: The “Rage” name is a shoutout to a popular line of graphics cards released by ATI in the early days of 3D acceleration before AMD purchased the company. ATIs “Fury” moniker made a comeback in graphics card form a few years back and now Rage will be back on every Radeonpowered PC. I dig it. radeon boost AMD Speaking of Radeon Software features AMD also briefly teased how its existing “Radeon Boost” and “Radeon AntiLag” features combine to improve latency in games that demand quick responses especially when paired with a FreeSync monitor. GeForce cards just gained the Nvidia Reflex suite of latency boosting features so its clear that game responsiveness is becoming a new battleground for graphics card makers. dx12 rdna2 AMD Finally like the GeForce RTX 30series AMDs Radeon 6000 graphics cards will be fully DirectX 12 Ultimatecompliant. Microsoft calls DX12 “a force multiplier for the entire gaming ecosystem” by unifying an array of new featuresmostly ones introduced in Nvidias RTX 20series but largely ignored by developersacross all PC and nextgen Xbox hardware. “When Xbox Series X releases there will already be many millions of DX12 Ultimate PC graphics cards in the world with the same feature set catalyzing a rapid adoption of new features and when Xbox Series X brings a wave of new console gamers PC will likewise benefit from this vast surge of new DX12 Ultimate capable hardware” Microsoft said when announcing the API. Being DirectX 12 Ultimatecompliant means the Radeon RX 6000 graphics cards will support variable rate shading mesh shading sampler feedback and yes realtime ray tracingthough AMD didnt go into details about its hotly anticipated ray tracing implementation. dx12u fidelityfx AMD AMD wasnt entirely mum though. Nvidia has a clear lead on ray tracing and the companys proprietary Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) plays a big role. The AI upscaling feature leverages the dedicated tensor cores in GeForce GPUs to speed up frame rates counterbalancing ray tracings performance impactbut remember its an Nvidiaproprietary technology. AMD teased a solution of its own as part of the companys open FidelityFX tools during todays presentation. Tucked away in the corner of the slide there was a small box that simply said “Super Resolution.” Herkelman wouldnt go into details but he confirmed to PCWorld that this will be AMDs open response to Nvidias DLSS designed to work on any graphics hardwareeven APUsand across various platforms because AMDs RDNA 2 GPUs also power the nextgen PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles. That broad adoption of AMD technologies could be an ace in the hole for Radeon s ray tracing future. The new consoles will be getting off the ground at roughly the same time as the Radeon RX 6000 series all bearing RDNA 2 GPUs. With the Radeon RX 6000 series Xbox Series X and even Nvidias RTX 30series all driving DirectX 12 Ultimate forward in the same time frame as well AMD is betting that DX12Us features will become ubiquitous. Everyone is working on the same page now. amd consoles AMD RDNA 2 isnt just for the Radeon RX 6000 graphics cards. As the graphics chip inside the consoles AMDs yettoberevealed ray tracing implementation could become the standard target for game developers despite Nvidias twoyear lead and impressive proprietary hardware. If AMD s ray tracing becomes the standard its opensource “Super Resolution” technology inside of FidelityFX could become the standard as well. DLSS 2.0 is black magic but its locked to Nvidia GPUs on PCs and requires custom code. Of course as with Infinity Cache and AMD Smart Access Memory it depends on the details. AMD isnt revealing anything more about Super Resolution today. Bottom line though? After seven long years AMDs RDNA 2equipped Radeon RX 6000 graphics cards are finally ready to bring the fight to Nvidia at the very edge of enthusiastclass performance. Well need to see if AMDs lofty claims hold up to scrutiny by independent testers but we cant wait to get our hands on these graphics cards.
