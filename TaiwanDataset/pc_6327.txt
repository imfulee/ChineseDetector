Asus confirms AMD Ryzen 5000 support on X470 B450 B450 II 資料來源： https://reurl.cc/r8YrMk 節錄最後一段 Now Asus has written to HEXUS to assert that the support person gave false information. To clarify the Asus senior marketing team says that Asus will follow AMDs support plan to release a new BIOS on X470 B450 and B450 II motherboards and all those available in the market at present will also be compatible with that BIOS upgrade. Beta BIOS support following AMD guidelines and timelines means this will be ready to roll out around Jan 2021. Additionally the newer B450 II motherboards feature USB Bios Flashback so youll be able to get a new CPU and upgrade the BIOS straight away without posting with a previous generation CPU. 簡單來說X470似乎不會被放生惹 。B450 II甚麼時候出啦。C7H再戰十年！。打手又造謠。#1VXSzuan (PC_Shopping)。你覺得打手造謠就去檢舉阿...。X370?。X370 AMD都說不支援了。只好買降價的3900了。原標不是Techpower 下的嗎 聯滄者也說放棄。https://i.imgur.com/fnqODe8.jpg。風向好亂。B450 ITX 不知道會不會上II版。AMD給 ASUS就支援阿。OP了。板子賣了啊啊啊。c7h的cp值又變更高了
